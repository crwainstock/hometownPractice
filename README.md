# Hometown Practice
This is a simple landing page featuring my hometown. It was made for a [SheCodes.io challenge (Nov. 2022)](https://www.shecodes.io/challenges).

## About
I've been coding for about 50 days, so not too long. I have learned basic html and css as well as some JavaScript. I went into this challenge hoping to use
some of the basic skills I've learned to create something specific. I didn't plan out exactly what I wanted to build until I started digging into the project, 
which maybe wasn't the best approach to the project.

I realized that any site I made would be functionally limited because I don't know a ton about JavaScript yet. I also don't know a ton about how to make 
a site responsive. So, I decided to focus on css that I already know. And I dug into using css to make the site a tiny bit responsive (the table/links are not responsive).

The project is written in a single html document per the requirements for the challenge. Normally, I would include a separate style sheet.

### Looking Ahead
I hope to revisit this project maybe 6 months or a year from now and redo it with the skills I've built between now and then. Until then, this is it!
